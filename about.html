    <h2>A LEARNING COMMUNITY</h2>
    <p>We offer choice when it comes to undergraduate majors and graduate programs. Our students pursue their passion
      while preparing for their careers through the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Health Sciences, School of
      Business and the School of Education and Human Services. Our faculty are personally invested in their students’
      success. They make it a priority to get to know them well, which translates to better support in helping them
      achieve their individual academic and personal goals. Carroll differentiates itself through its Pioneer Core. This
      unique general education requirement weaves a cross-cultural emphasis throughout a student’s academic career,
      exposing them to cultures, ideas and beliefs different from their own.</p>

          ones, in areas such as music, theater, art, photography and more. And with 50+ student organizations, it’s
          easy to explore different interests and make friends.</p>

      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>Carroll University, often called Wisconsin's pioneer college, is the first four-year institution of higher
        education in the state. We trace our history all the way back to the founding of Prairieville Academy in 1841.
        The university was chartered by the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature on January 31, 1846—two years before
        Wisconsin became a state.</p>
